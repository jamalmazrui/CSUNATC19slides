<h1>Inclusive Design and Prototyping from Start to Finish: Setting a Place at
the Table </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 1</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Good morning and welcome everyone. My name is Jack Nicolai,
I am an Accessibility Product Manager at Adobe. I’m glad to see everyone here
at this early hour. I had an 8am slot last year as well. I’m not much of a
morning person, so I’m not sure whether this timeslot is punishment or a
reward, but at least they invited me back to speak to all of you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I started working on this presentation because I wanted to
talk about the design process through a different lens. My talk last year was
pretty technical. It focused on very practical steps to document accessibility
requirements in user stories, design specs and test cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 2</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This year, while I do want to talk about Inclusive Design, I
also want to talk about cooking and how when we invite people into our homes,
we can best set a place for them at the table.  For me, cooking is a passion.
I’m able to express myself in a number of different ways. From choosing
recipes, planning menus, to hosting groups of friends for dinner, there are
many parallels between what we need to do to deliver a wonderful experience to
our guests and the design process needed to creative inclusive, ability-focused
user experiences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My hope is that you will come away with new points of
connection between how to care for the people who you welcome into your home
and how you design software in order that in both cases you are taking steps to
set a place for them at the table where they can partake in the things that you
have created, be nourished by them and be inspired to do the same thing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 3</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To do this, we must start with hospitality. Better Crocker’s
Guide to Easy Entertaining notes that the dictionary defines hospitality as
“being disposed to entertain with generous kindness.” It then sets out to teach
the reader…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>How to be “disposed” by being ready in detail and in spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>How to “entertain” yourself as well as others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>How to be “generous” by providing delicious and suitable food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>How to serve it “with kindness” so that guests are not dismayed
by a do-it-herself hostess who deserts them for her kitchen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, the book was published in 1959 so some of the language
is little dated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 4</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chefs are inclusive designers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don’t know about you, but I have a group of friends with a
variety of foods allergies and preferences. Some are vegan. Some are gluten
free. One just doesn’t like berries and fresh cuts tomatoes. Another friend is
allergic to anything in the nightshade family. Honestly, I have to look up the
list of what is included in the nightshade family every time I’m cooking for
this friend. Additional considerations include age, mobility, and even the ability
to chew certain foods, whether you are young or old. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A part of knowing how to set a place for someone at your
table is to get to know their needs and preferences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 5</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, we must decide who can attend. Who’s in and who’s out?
The size of one’s home usually dictates how many people we can entertain. When
designing software, it is rare that we are creating a product that is intended
to only be used by a small number of people, so we can’t be selective about who
shows up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 6</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kat Holmes, Founder of Mismatch.design and Director of User
Experience at Google recently published a book called <i>Mismatch: how
inclusion shapes design</i>. In it, she explores what it really means to be
inclusive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 7</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>She describes inclusion using the image of a circle, a
boundary. In it are the things that are effectively included, with the word
“IN” in large capital letters inside the circle. Surrounding this circle are
the five instance of the word “OUT” to represent how some things are shut in
and others are shut out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 8</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>She goes on to provide a definition of Inclusive Design from
her time at Microsoft. Inclusive Design is a methodology that enables and draws
on the full range of human diversity. Most importantly, this means including
and learning from people with a range of perspectives. (I would amend that to
include a range of abilities.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 9</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>She goes on to describe how we must break the original model
of inclusion when inclusion results in shutting others out. In this version of
the earlier image, the circle now contains as series gaps around the
circumference, representing the breakdown of barriers towards inclusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 10</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we plan our meal, we should consider how guests will
partake in the meal we prepare. What utensils should be placed at the table? Do
they fit the needs of the food and your guest? Are they the right ones for the
job?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 11</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the beginning our hands have been our utensils. Picking
up and placing food into our mouths. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 12</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over time different tools have been adopted. Here we have a
pair of chopsticks. The decision to use one utensil or another may be influenced
by culture or the nature of the food you’re eating or simply someone’s
preference. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 13</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The use of some tools, such as a fork, knife and spoon have
become so ingrained as to be thought of as ubiquitous and suitable for all
purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 14</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some matches seem to immediately make sense. In this
example, we see a sushi role and pair of chopsticks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 15</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>We could just as easily put down the chopsticks and use our
hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 16</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes we provide our guests with utensils that aren’t
exactly a mismatch, as in this example of a sushi role and a fork, but that
don’t quite feel like the right solution…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 17</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>And may create unnecessary friction as in this this case
with a sushi role and a butter knife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 18</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes a mismatch clear. When given a bowl of creamy soup
you don’t expect to be handed a butter knife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 19</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>That same bowl may be used to serve something different,
such as rice, in which case chopsticks make more sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 20</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>For more complex interactions, more than one utensil may be
required. Here we have an example of a lovely young girl who appears to be
exuberantly enjoying a bowl of ramen. Notice that she is using two utensils, a
pair of chopsticks to pick up the noodles and a spoon to ladle up the broth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>{PAUSE}</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes we try to come up with a universal solution to
solve complex problems, but that don’t quite work as expected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 21</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, there is the spork, probably one of the most
derided utensils, both a fork and a spoon or rather, neither a fork nor a
spoon. Have you ever tried to use one? They tines don’t to pick up food well and
the spoon portion doesn’t hold much soup. While this utensil was well
intentioned the outcome is less useful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You might suggest, that this problem can solved with a
utensil the guest already has.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 22</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we see a bowl and two hands. I could pick up the bowl
of ramen tip it towards me to slurp up all of the delicious ingredients.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 23</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>We must though keep in mind that guests have a variety of
shapes, sizes and abilities. Image alt text: A young girl with no arms, eating
a cob of corn with her feet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>{PAUSE}</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 24</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>For years, most of my dinner parties featured dishes I had
never cooked before. I was inspired to try something new and wanted to share it
with my friends. I thought I was so cool. Can you imagine what might have gone
wrong?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is through preparation that we can avoid pitfalls when
presenting an audience with something new.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 25</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merriam-Webster defines mise en place as “a culinary process
in which ingredients are prepared and organized before cooking”. “The purpose
of mise en place is to allow the chef to cook in the most efficient way without
having to stop. While it won’t prevent you from drying out a roast, burning a
batch of cookies or deflating a soufflé, it will make you a better cook by
changing the way you work though preparing a meal from inception to clean-up
(Mise en Place). Pictured are set of ingredients prepared to assemble in an
enchilada casserole recipe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By mastering certain basics like knife skills and “mise en
place”, you built up a level of confidence that so that you can take on more
challenging cuisine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a similar way, designers must build up foundational
skills so that we are better equipped to take on the more complex user
experience challenges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 26</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using quality ingredients in your designs means using design
systems, UI component libraries, UX design patterns and tools that have already
been designed inclusively. At Adobe, we have applied Inclusive Design thinking
to our own Spectrum Design System in order that every designer that uses it,
can have confidence that they will deliver a more inclusive experience. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 27</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’ve interviewed designers and accessibility professionals
from a variety of software companies and frankly none of them had a great story
to tell. Most of them are in a similar place. They are putting checks in place
in various states of the design, development and test processes. How do we get
it right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s take a look at one example where I think we are headed
in the right direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 28</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Incorporating Social Factors</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A study conducted at the University of Washington called,
Incorporating Social Factors in Accessible Design by Kristen Shinohara, Jacob
O. Wobbrock, and Wanda Pratt was conducted to test the idea that new challenges
are presented when using technology in a social context.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Ultimately, they found beneficial outcomes when disabled and
nondisabled users were grouped together with a designer working on a solution. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 29</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the study designers used a tool called Methods Cards
like the one we see pictured here. They are intended to be used alongside users
in the design process rather than in lieu of, like Personas. The scenarios were
drawn from prior research where participants with disabilities revealed some
version of these events in studies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This one is titled, NON-USE. Each card has two sides and is
broken up into four sections, Scenario, Consider, Design + Reflect, and Ask
Users.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s step through this card.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Scenario</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People may choose not to use technology in some social
situations because they feel uncomfortable, such as when worrying that others
will notice hearing aids, or when feeling rude that a talking watch announces
every hour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Consider</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What are social situations (i.e., a party, at work) where
technology use is unappealing or inappropriate?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To what extent does discomfort in technology use depend on
the type of technology, i.e., accessible options, like hearing aids vs. a
smartphone?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Design + Reflect</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How might your design be inappropriate or unappealing to use
when around others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ask Users</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When do you feel un/comfortable using technology?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When do you choose not to use technology?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A link to more information about this study and the Method
cards is provided at the end of this deck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>{PAUSE}</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we want our dinner guests to truly feel welcome, we must
consider how the guests will interact with one another. How might their
behavior and experience be affected by those around them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 30</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the challenges Top Chef competitors must face is to
take a dish normally prepared in a traditional way and deliver in a completely
new way. Take for example a challenge to prepare Beef Bourguignon, a beef stew
braised in red wine and beef stock, flavored with carrots, onions, garlic, and a
bouquet garni. The challenge is to serve this dish as a meal you can eat on the
go with your hands. Do you make into a taco? Do you wrap it in a pita? Perhaps
instead, you devise a way to prepare the dish such that the diner can decide
how they wish the dish to be served?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 31</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jacob Wobbrock, who is a Professor of&nbsp;<a
href="http://old.sigchi.org/cdg/cdg2.html"><b>human-computer interaction (HCI)</b></a>&nbsp;in
the&nbsp;<a href="http://ischool.uw.edu/"><b>Information School</b></a><b><u> </u></b>at
the University of Washington, where he also directs the&nbsp;<a
href="http://depts.washington.edu/madlab/"><b>Mobile &amp; Accessible Design
Lab</b></a>. He talks about a concept called Ability-based Design. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ability-based design is “A design approach in which the
human abilities required to operate an interactive system are questioned, and
systems are made operable by and adaptable to alternative abilities.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From his point of view, “Everyone has abilities, some people
have more than others. We need to design for people with abilities of all
types.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 32</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adaptive Software</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At Adobe, we have begun building applications like Lightroom
that centralize business logic and user data in the cloud, which enables us to
bring the same features to various surfaces, customizing the UI to best fit
each surface and ideally each user.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to build
software which adapts to the abilities of the user.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The user interface is separated from the business logic so that
new interfaces can be crafted when presented with new abilities. The software
would learn how to adapt to the new interface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 33</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>We know we’ve set the table when…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>ability (not disability) drives success for creatives in the
workforce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>companies big and small employ designers representing a range of
abilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>We validate our designs throughout the design process, with users
of various abilities, incorporating social factors (because we don’t design
alone).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 34</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>{PAUSE}</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 35</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we view our users as guests… it becomes easier to
imagine setting a place for them at the table. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 36</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>How will you set the table? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Slide 37</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thank you. Bon Appetit.</p>
