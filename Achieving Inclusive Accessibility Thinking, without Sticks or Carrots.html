They expanded on previous BBC guidelines;  included considerable referencing of other widely accepted guidelines, such as WCAG, Funka, Android and iOS; and worked closely with various BBC product and research teams to figure out what guidance the BBC needed. This was followed by several rounds of feedback from other BBC staff and non-BBC experts.\n\nRecently the BBC Mobile Accessibility Guidelines were updated following an 18 month long review, that began with research into accessibility for online games and interactive content. It was also an opportunity to make the guidelines relevant for a broader audience, use clearer language, and make adjustments for technology advances in the industry.\n\nThe guidelines are written, predominantly, for BBC digital development teams, or agencies contracted to do such work for the BBC. Originally they focused on developers and testers, and now have relevance for designers and many others involved in the process.\n\nThe guidelines do not contradict WCAG or other industry guidelines, but incorporate and expand on them, with some BBC specific additions.\n\nDespite misconceptions, the Mobile Accessibility Guidelines cover responsive web pages as well as native applications. And as such, they replace any previous accessibility guidelines for BBC digital content.\n\nThe BBC guidelines can be found via the short links http://bbc.in/asg or http://bbc.in/SFOzh0.","baf275441f93adbb0e7ce812977ff3bd":"Through growth of a network of accessibility champions, or advocates, our team recognised an ever increasing need for accessibility to be part of requirements gathering, research and design. \n\nThe guidelines could help counteract unconscious bias and increase awareness about accessibility for non-technical people in product teams, but they needed to better accommodate this wider audience.\n\nUK regulators expect the BBC, a large public organisation, to operate and exceed legal standards and requirements for accessibility, which have broadened in scope in recent years. \n\nAs an industry leader in the UK, making new digital products accessible often means figuring out how, so the regulators do give some allowance for not always get it right first time, so long as the BBC is always trying to improve accessibility.\n\nThe BBC is not allowed to be the world's worst website.\n\n... and there's more...","b86aae6f6d81e4082aafa1e1d4765a60":"Games and playful gamification has an amazing ability to draw people in and motivate them to read more or keep trying. This is vital for those needing to overcome impairments that can make things difficult, especially when combined with favourite characters from beloved television programmes. Like Mr. Tumble, pictured, one of the UK's most loved Children's TV characters.\n\nUnderstanding cause and effect is the first step for many severely disabled children in a journey to learning assistive technology that can provide communication and greater independence.\n\n(click)\n\nHTML5 + Javascript canvas means there can be more control over accessibility than prior technologies, and interactive content can use more native elements which have built in accessibility.\n\n(click)\n\nNor is interactive content just for children. News and Sport regularly create interactive widgets, as do Knowledge and Learning - for adults as well as children.","7aeff456dd37c3fe5595b994d0e6361b":"We wanted to make sure each guideline, and the explanation for each guideline, could be understood by everyone, including less technical colleagues in production teams. So we adopted a Plain English approach and cross-referenced for consistency.\n\n* Short sentences with no unnecessary words. \n* Active verbs rather than abstracted verbs (complete rather than completion). \n* Giving instruction when appropriate and using everyday audience appropriate words. \n* And using headings and lists to help readers understand the structure.\n\nYou may notice that GEL also uses Plain English and also adopts a less formal style.\n\nThe image on screen reads \"Dear Larry, let me tell you this in plain English. It's over! ... and also in HTML \u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\u003ccenter\u003e\u003cb\u003eIt's over!\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e.","0ad6279fde6cd76d1748eb640650a705":"What if the clothing industry made every outfit as a âone size fits allâ. \n\nPeople come in many shapes and sizes. Ranging in height from 2 foot to 8 foot. Skinny, rotund, top heavy, bottom heavy, or bulging with muscle or other lumps. And that's before considering preferences in colour or fabric.\n\nHow many people would one size would fit well? How many would want to wear it?\n\nAnd how does that apply to digital output?\n","56f0409979f1ef5d9750ef4c1ae7ab08":"So first - a potted history.","a4caf0dbfb65b46255e047644afff44b":"As many of you will know, Technology is a fast paced ever-advancing industry. A landscape that is constantly changing.\n\nIn the past 4 years there has been vast increases in the use of smart phones and tablets, following device and network improvements and more affordable data plans. There has been an increase in wearable technology, such as smart watches, and in internet connected things, such as lights or home heating that can be controlled via apps. And there has been significant advances in hardware and systems for virtual reality and augmented reality.\n\n(click)\n\nThere is also more availability of better accessibility features, built in as part of operating systems. There is better and broader support in browsers for newer code standards, such as HTML 5, CSS 3 and new Javascript services. And big leaps in artificial intelligence and computer learning, that facilitates conversation interfaces and voice interfaces, such as iOS Siri, Google assistant, and Amazon's Alexa.\n\n(click)\n\nAnd those advances carry through into the area of assistive technology, that brings everyone to CSUN. Native apps have helped to bring assistive technology to the home, more affordably and better personalised.","da1f20243164171da5f92715dec72164":"And coding languages rarely sit still either. There are regular advances, new methods and properties, and even new languages.\n\nHTML5 and CSS3 are both much more stable code standards, and have broad support in a wide field of browsers. Javascript is now a core tool, powering in-browser apps as capable as installed software, and much less likely to be disabling thanks to ARIA. And, of course, in the mobile arena Apple have developed Swift for building native apps for iOS devices.\n\nMeanwhile, designs have had to become more responsive, adapting to screen size so that content only needs to exist in one place. Apple developed and encourage their Human Interface Guidelines. Android developed their Material Design Guidelines. And the BBC have created their own design guidance in the shape of GEL, a Global Experience Language, which incorporates the accessibility guidelines.\n","8ab1b3a8cef10a496e87555131e3e757":"The BBC guidelines can be found via the short links http://bbc.in/asg or http://bbc.in/SFOzh0.\n\nWe still have further feedback to come, so there may yet be minor tweaks to some of the descriptions, examples and test instructions, but the changes went public this morning (2 March 2017).\n\nIncidentally, the section of the BBC website that currently links out the the guidelines is to be decommissioned later this year, so we have also be working on a new BBC site for accessibility guidance. The short links will continue to work following that change, whenever it happens. ","ae5302f0e68827104b717f81891af5a7":"Volume control - Separate volume controls should be provided for background music, ambient sounds, narrative and editorially significant sound effects. (Helpful for those with sensory sensitivities and screen reader users - yes, we are starting to think about screen reader users within game development.)\n\nAudio conflict - Narrative audio in games or interactive media should not talk over or conflict with native assistive technology. (We are still doing research into how best to achieve this.)\n\nAdjustability - Interactive media, including games, should be adjustable for user ability and preference. (There is no one size fits all.)\n\nFlicker - Content must not visibly or intentionally flicker or flash more than three times in any one-second period. (This guideline was to be included originally but somehow was not published.)\n\nFeedback and assistance - Non-critical feedback or assistance should be provided when appropriate. (This can prevent users becoming discouraged as they learn something new.)\n\nInput controls - Interaction input control should be adaptable. (Such as setting up to use keys on the left of the keyboard, or as a single control key.)","93c83211c1f4bdade2a81118ecea1129":"Technical advances mean transcripts are less prevalent, and that subtitles and other alternatives are more available, so these guidelines were rolled together. This combined guideline was then expanded to cover more than just long-form AV content. It now covers short-form AV content and clips, and interactive content such as games.\n\nAutoplay now covers continous play as well as automatic play on page/screen load.\n\nBecause of changes in how OS and browsers can magnify and zoom content, the original zoom guideline had become redundant. However, we decided some guidance was still needed to encourage responsive text sizes and not breaking zoom features.\n\nThe guideline on consistency and choice was a confusion of things, so we split it into two guidelines.\n\nAnd Actionable elements has been reworded to cover interactive content, such as games.","644556d8ef73c32ffb040125199f089a":"Lastly, where can you find the guidelines...","a0d68aeff1eecf973782435446193450":"So why did things need to change?","87f0671b675b6627b1654ed40fc43fa5":"A potted summary of the process...","34b9ee4a6681589fd02175073f80ed6a":"Three reports were commissioned and analysed for best practice recommendations for games. They were then mapped against the existing guidelines. Of the 13 main recommendations, 6 became new guidelines, and 7 were incorporated into existing guidelines.\n\nA team review of the original guidelines happened summer 2015, but life happens and vacations and other work meant progress was slow. So Becky and I started having weekly meetings to review and edit guidelines, which afterward were reviewed by Gareth and Jamie. \n\nThere were many involved discussions on the meaning and nuances of words and phrases, often via Slack to facilitate remote working. And some changes needed the whole team together to discuss options and make decisions.\n\nGuidelines are hard!\n\nAnd after all that, there were still consistency checks, example reviews, and review \u0026 feedback by other BBC colleagues.","796f958addf8128e0cbb170f9e72cebe":"So, after all that ... let's look at what is new and what has changed ...","632c3edb0f5b771cf3877dc0ab1eb88e":"Indictating language and Changing language have been merged into a single guideline.\n\nInstructions has been moved to the Editorial section, as it felt a better fit, although it links out to other guidelines on labelling and notifications.\n\nUser interactions replaces what was Touch events and covers a broader range of inputs, splitting to those that generate a click event and those that generate a keypress event. It also acknowledges that interactive content may need to use low level events for a better experience, and what those should be.\n\nAlternative input methods has been expanded to clearly cover interactive content, encouraging multiple input/control methods. For example, a carousel must not reply in swipe or mouse gestures, but should also provide button controls and/or tab through items while moving them into view as they receive focus.","34a401509bb76469d0d5edff2ab456fb":"Thank you. \n\nFor anyone interested, the slide deck is available at slides.com/emmajpr/inclusive-a11y, and the speaker notes include URLs for lots of reference material. (other BBC slide decks at https://bbc.github.io/csun/)\n\nIf you have any questions please ask or contact EmmaJ_PR via Twitter.\n","4132fe680e2f3deea08ca49de7ee239c":"Labelling form controls and Form inputs replace Input labels and Keyboard input types, and a good examples of rewriting in plainer language to provide greater clarity.\n\nManaging focus has been moved from the Focus section to the Forms section, as it is predominantly about not moving the focus while an input field is being completed.\n\nInclusive notifications was the focus of quite a bit of team discussion, as it combines Changes of state and Visual cues and audio alerts. Our initial rewrites produced two guidelines that were very similar, so it started to make sense to combine the points they were making into a single guideline that covers all scenarios.","5731f8e35a0560dbf72e050ccb181606":"Progressive functionality replaces Javascript alternatives, as Javascript is now better supported and, with the help of ARIA, less problematic for accessibility. Enhancing a base accessible experience progressively covers robustness and feature availability. The guideline also advices using \u003cnoscript\u003e to inform users when Javascript is essential for content, such as embedded video or interactive content.\n\nControlling media and Grouped elements now cover interactive content.\n\nRoles, traits and properties got a little rename, to be more complete. And like the remaining guidelines (there are 54 in total) has been rewritten in plainer English.","e34bf7d138360b68dc75ca352ff3d310":"In addition to the mute control, separate volume controls should be provided in settings for interactive media, such as games, \nto minimise the risk of sensory overload for users with audio sensitivity.\n\nThis minimises the risk of sensory shock.\n\nThose with hearing impairment may need to adjust different audio elements to hear the narrative speech clearly.\n\nAnd screen reader users need to be able to hear the screen reader over the sounds within interactive media.\n\n\nIn order to interact with embedded media, all users need to perceive the editorial narrative and/or instructions.\n\nIf the embedded media is self-voicing content, then this does not need to be available to the screen reader. If the embedded media is providing content to the screen reader, then this does not need to be self-voicing.\n\nNote: Further research is currently being conducted to ascertain user preferences.\n","912ae5f20ce9394f14932f61b6c63a63":"Users of interactive media have differing abilities and preferences. Where appropriate, adjustment should be offered to make an experience inclusive and enable everyone to join in.\n\nFor example, users in bright sunlight, experiencing a migraine, or with vision impairment may choose to adjust the contrast and text size, or enable a colour blind mode. Users in a noisy environment, needing quiet, or with hearing impairment may wish to adjust the volume or enabled subtitles. Users carrying something, nursing a hand injury, or with motor impairment may want to adjust the controls and pace. Younger users, those less familiar with technology, or with a cognitive impairment may adjust a difficulty level, use tutorials or enable hints.\n\n\nVisual flicker, flashing and strobe lighting can affect anyone, but some users will be more susceptible than others. Symptoms may include eyestrain, dizziness, fatigue, headaches, migraine, and nausea. Users with medical conditions such as MÃ©niÃ¨re's or photosensitive epilepsy can be severely affected, experiencing vertigo, hearing loss and seizures.\n\nA well-documented example of the effects of flicker is PokÃ©mon Shock.\n\nIf flicker is unavoidable, the user must be warned before they reach the content.\n\nWhere editorially appropriate, provide an alternative version of content that does not flicker but is as close to the original as possible.\n\nThere is further information on flashing images within BBC Editorial Policy.\n","5e734102167aa977febc0823314428e8":"Occasional feedback and assistance can help people learn how to use something unfamiliar. It can be especially helpful for young children and people with cognitive impairments.\n\nWhen someone is not completing an objective correctly and/or does not progress multiple times, support and encouragement can motivate them to continue or keep trying.

For example, it could be difficult to learn or work if you're worried where your next meal will come from or if you will have shelter to sleep. Maslow considered the most basic needs to be physiological: breathing, hunger, thirst, sleep, etc. Next is safety: shelter, health, security, abuse, etc. Then social belonging: family, friends, support, intimacy, etc. Then esteem: confidence, recognition, respect from and for others, etc, with a higher level being self-esteem and self-respect.  And the most complex need is self-actualisation: realising and mastering one's potential, which can progress to transcendence: helping others to achieve their potential.\n\nThe ERG theory by Clayton Alderfer condenses Maslow's hierarchy into 3 categories: existence (things needed to keep existing), relatedness (things needed to maintain relationships), and growth (things needed for personal development).\n\nHowever intertwined these motivating needs actually are, in the society most of us operate in, wages, welfare and housing programmes take care of existence needs for most people.

Then came guidelines like WCAG 1.0 in 1999 (Happy 20th birthday WCAG!), with version 2.0 in 2008 and 2.1 in 2018 ... and laws like the UK's Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and Equality Act 2010, and the USA's the Americans with Disabilities Act 1990 and the 508 Amendment in 1998 to the 1973 Rehabilitation Act (Happy 21st birthday 508!). These were the sticks to motivate people. The carrots of improved reputation and increased revenue eventually became evident for some, but up to 90% of websites and apps are still not meeting WCAG single-A standard 20 years on (https://www.abilitynet.org.uk/techsharepro/carrots-vs-sticks).\n\nFor a public service organisation like the BBC, those legal sticks were early motivators, but increased revenue is never going to be a compelling carrot. However, once the BBC was established as an online service provider, we put guidelines in place, created training for those who were interested, and encouraged adherence.\n\nTraining wasn't mandatory. Auditing and policing guidelines was ineffective, and happened too late to have a real impact. We needed some motivation that was present more regularly and could help guide people on what to do. The approach we adopted 5 years ago was accessibility champions. Initially this was a few select colleagues from different key product teams, who were given training and expected to share and dissipate that knowledge with the teams they worked with. These early champions were essentially a stick, albeit a very gentle nudging reminder of what was supposed to be done.\n\nFive years on, our champions approach has evolved considerably:\n\n - First, we noticed that multiple champions within a product team support each other and get less pushback. So we have encouraged multiple champions within product teams. More champions means wider sharing of knowledge across the organisation and greater cross-team support (and not just for accessibility). \n\n - Second, we noticed that champions earlier in the process have a ripple impact further along the process. So we have encouraged designers and business analysts to be champions, as well as developers and testers, and we've put in place mandatory accessibility training for all designers. A quick dig into the WAI responsibility breakdown of WCAG reveals that almost 95% of accessibility thinking should start before any code is written (https://www.w3.org/community/wai-engage/wiki/Accessibility_Responsibility_Breakdown and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ovXWPxkA4c talk by Bill Tyler and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTee8Hol1kM talk by Derek Featherstone).\n\n- Thirdly, we noticed that getting our champions talking to one another sparked ideas, shared techniques and other such magic. So we have encouraged networking through communication tools and meet-ups. Established champions support and encourage newer champions who in turn bring a fresh sense of wonder and curiosity and enthusiasm. We love dropping in on groups of accessibility champions and hearing about the work they are doing to improve the accessibility of their products. It inspires us and assures us we're moving in the right direction, and we respond with fresh appreciation and validation of the work they are doing. Networking and dropping in provide opportunities for reflection, which amplifies impact and makes achievements more meaningful (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/only-thing-makes-work-meaningful-aaron-hurst/).\n\nMost importantly, our network of accessibility champions has reached a point where others want to become champions because of a conversation they had with an existing champion. We rarely have to seek out new accessibility champions. We have also reached a point where the culture of some teams has changed so that accessibility is an integrated part of an inclusive approach. Audits are no longer needed as testing accessibility requirements happens along with everything else. For those teams, accessibility has become an intrinsic part of best practice and quality of work. There is still space for improvement, but if ever the proof was in the pudding, our complaints about accessibility have significantly reduced from several a month to 1 or 2 a year.\n\nThe sticks and carrots still have their place, motivating the business and the industry. For the teams who have made accessibility thinking part of their day to day process their motivation is now much more intrinsic and long term. The guidelines are just guidelines, a starting point not a checklist. And they are bringing others along with them. This approach has become a cycle of intrinsic motivation.\n\nOn screen is a graphic of evolving man, early man thinking about survival, middle man thinking about punishments and rewards, and evolved man thinking about lifting others.","9dd23764cd1ce59bbd10d8e54f6ce331":"Lyndall Urwicks' Theory Z: proposes that individuals are motivated when they know an organisations goals and understand how their efforts contribute, and in turn how such association with the organisation will positively satisfy their own needs.\n\nOn screen is a diagram of Urwicks' theory and a photo of the BBC values.\n\nEmma definitely recognises this approach in some of how the BBC operates. Her pass carries the organisation's mission and values on the back, and her annual objectives are based on those values and subsequent departmental goals. For example, a particularly pertinent value is \"The Audience is at the heart of everything we do.\"\n","e56211d5049b4533468620be0b7499f8":"Lawrence Miller's recent hierarchy of motivation may be less well known, yet it struck a chord and combine's elements of several of the other theories mentioned. He recognises that people are motivated by different things at different times, and sometimes by multiple things at the same time. He also recognises that it will be most effective to optimise on all aspects of motivation, not one. The three sources of motivation he identifies are Purpose or Meaning: focus on spiritual and wider society impact, Social Relationships: focus on the team or community and belonging, and Situational Rewards and Punishments: focus on material outcomes and self. They should be judged as equally significant, and equally important at different times. However, there is plenty of evidence that people focused only on material and self tend to be less content then people focused on an ennobling purpose: making a difference in the world. People who are physically or mentally unwell can become very focussed on self, and doing something for others can be instrumental in improving their wellbeing.\n\nOn screen is a diagram of Miller's hierarchy.\n\nRewards and punishments, the carrots and sticks, are good incentives, but they are extrinsic motivators. Most aspects of Social Relationships are also extrinsic motivators, where the motivation comes from outside of self. It is meaning and purpose that act as intrinsic motivators, where the motivation comes from within. And intrinsic motivators are powerful, so long as the other motivators are not absent.\n\nThey work best when all are at work. This is synergistic motivation (combining empowerment, recognition and rewards).\n\nhttp://www.lmmiller.com/employee-involvement-empowerment-engagement-happened/\n","32ff1c18b97a4954909cfda476c80c8b":"Vroom's Expectancy Theory: is founded on the idea that people will be motivated when they believe there is a correlation between the effort they put in, the performance they achieve, and the resultant outcomes and rewards.
